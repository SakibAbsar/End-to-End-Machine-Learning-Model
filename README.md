# End-to-End Machine Learning Model

## Overview
This project covers a complete machine learning workflow, from data processing to deployment and monitoring.

## Structure
- **Data Processing**: Data cleaning and feature engineering
- **Modeling**: Model training and evaluation
- **Deployment**: Flask API setup for model predictions
- **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring and alerts

## Setup
Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Run data preprocessing: `python src/data_preprocessing.py`
2. Train the model: `python src/model_training.py`
3. Serve the model: `python deployment/app.py`
